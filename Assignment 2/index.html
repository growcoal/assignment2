				<h3>Project overview</h3>
				<p>Project Overview
                   My concept for this assignment was to look into data protection and the sharing of information on the internet, I wanted to specifically focus on "nudes" or sharing of intimate images. This is a <a href="https://www.renews.co.nz/photos-of-my-sexual-abuse-were-shared-online-now-im-starting-a-movement/?fbclid=IwAR0VnW0G4QsGY8LsvfHCWxc6bYAjemHUYGGK-dIu6onXCG-mToyhp3PTsnw" target="_blank">link</a> to a video that inspired me about the whole idea. knowledge on the internet's data privacy is pretty limited for people and i would like to inform and tell people a bit more about what happens when they share private information online. Social media was one of my biggest focuses, specifically image sharing on things like Snapchat. Users can send a photo on Snapchat and set a time limit for how long someone can view the image for, in doing so users believe that after this allotted time the image will delete itself. This however is not the case as it stores data which means the photo doesn't just simply delete or disappear it sits in a computer for up to 30 days in which it could get accessed, without even mentioning the concept of screenshotting the image. This is a <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/103625068/wellington-bars-to-offer-angel-shots-for-women-who-feel-unsafe-on-a-night-out" target="_blank">link</a> to an article talking about sophies angles and also angel shots. I got inspiration from this business idea and the guardian angel looking after you inspired the idea from branding that I had.

				<h3>Logo</h3>
				<p>This is the logo I created for the Check your Consent website, there are angel wings signifying the guardian angel concept that I had and there are two checks on the back which are structural supports for the wings but also signifying the checking your consent, and finally the C’s that are connected to the ticks, representing the C’s in the name. </p>

				<h3>Typography</h3>
				<p>This is the fonts that I have chosen for my website, my primary and secondary fonts. I wanted quite basic and clear fonts as I am talking about a quite serious topic and don't want the font to be too complicated. So by keeping it simple you can focus more on the topic. </p>

				<h3>Colour Palette</h3>
				<p>This is the colour pallete that I chose for my website. I liked the purple as it kept the colours simple and basic. This meant that there were lots of variations that I could do for my website. It keeps the message clear and focused on the topic.</p>

			<h3>Inital ideas for physical submission</h3>
			<h4>Idea One:</h4>
			<p>One of my ideas was to create a website that sends you a notification if someone is publishing an image of them without consent, this focused more  on images on Instagram or facebook, and these would be public posts. I decided however than not only was this a rather complicated design, but not really what i wanted to focus on. I want to focus more on non consusental nude image sharing.</p>

			<h4>Idea Two:</h4>
			<p>Another idea was to create an public intervention focused on unsuspecting/foot traffic type of audience, I liked this idea more as it can be seen by any person walking nearby, not limiting itself to being viewed online. My thought could be that it is focused around mirrors, as people love to look at themselves, I figured this could be a good way to catch unsuspecting or curious people and draw them into learning about sharing nonconsensual images. And this was the idea that I chose to carry forward to prototype and develop.</p>

				<h3>Concept drawing 1</h3>
				<p>One of my ideas was to set heaps of mirrors on the wall so that you don't see all of the body but see different parts, illustrating that you might not know about the photos, or in example of the mirrors you might miss that your legs are on show.</p>

				<h3>Concept drawing 2</h3>
				<p>One of my other ideas was to break a mirror and place the shards on the wall to illustrate the brokenness that can come as a result of sharing the images. So if you looked directly into the middle of the mirror you can only see yourself shattered. I placed a QR code concept in the corner to show how the person could learn more about the installation.</p>

				<h3>Test photos</h3>
				<p>These are some test photo concepts that I took. I wanted to see how the idea might work of only seeing parts of the body rather than the whole image. So for my final assignment I will play around with the idea of mirrors and linking the QR code to the website for assignment 1.</p>
